Final Project for Experimental Design (Stat 158) at UC Berkeley -- reanalysis of Enos and Fowler's Stratified Randomized Experiment using regression adjustment, post stratification and matched pair experiment.
The first part of the analysis is a replication of their results.
Enos and Fowler conducted a SRE to understand if pivotality increases voter turnout during elections.
